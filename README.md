### Abstract

This is a portfolio of my code samples, taken from the professional projects
where I have personally led the development and engineering effort,
over my 5+ years of industry experience in Full-Stack Cross-Platform Development.


### Curation Note

To keep this portfolio quickly-browsable and high-signal for the reviewer,s
I have tried to include ONLY specific bits-and-pieces of the projects,
and excluded all boilerplate code.

Kind request to the reviewer to please ping me for full project code,
and/or detailed discussion about my specific design / engineering choices
such as my approach / intention / thinking.

### Overview

```
  1. C++ Object-Oriented/
      • taken from one of my **academic** class projects - _TunnelMan game_
      • objective was to implement a single-player graphical (2-D grid) game, given :-
          • an OpenGL/GLUT project code skeleton, with game-controller and asset files
          • intended game rules & logic that involved several computer controlled
            actors that interacted with the player, and miscellaneous collectible objects.
  
  2. JavaScript-Angular-MVC.md
      • javascript, angular.js
      • client-side heavy application
          • single page application, client side routing
      • ui components / templates
      • controllers, component state
      • services
          • application state
          • models
          • data fetching & backend rpc
          • client-side routing
          • caching, logging

  
  3. TypeScript-Pipeline-WorkerProcess.md
      • typescript, node.js, aws sdk, mongodb, mongoose
      • streams and pipeline based worker process
      • aws sdk wrappers (sqs, ses)
      • pipeline, streams, worker process
      • takes work units 1-by-1 off sqs message queue
      • processes the work unit through a pipeline of transform streams

  
  4. TypeScript-REST-API.md
      • typescript, node.js, restify, mongodb, mongoose
      • rest based web service
      • proxy for google calendar rest api
      • mongodb orm for persistence / query
      • url-path-based routers
